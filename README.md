The code of CDLNet: Collaborative Dictionary Learning Network for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification

Here are some tips for running EMSCNet:  
1. AID, NWPU, and UCM data sets should be placed in the /data directory.  
2. We provide the training code for the AID dataset under EMSCNet (ResNet-50) in train.py.
3. Before executing, please install the timm library and make adjustments to the resnet file to extract feature maps from the last three residual blocks.
4. If you have other problems about the article or the codes, please contact us by this email: zhaoyibo2027@163.com. Thanks for your support.
